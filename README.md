### Developer Tools

`bvpbot` uses [tools.build](https://clojure.org/guides/tools_build) for development-time automation. The full list of available build tasks can be obtained by running:

```shell
$ clojure -A:deps -T:build help/doc
```

### Developer Workflow

This project uses the [git-flow branching strategy](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/), and the permanent branches are called `release` and `dev`. Any changes to the `release` branch are considered a release and auto-deployed to the hosting service.

For this reason, **all development must occur either in branch `dev`, or (preferably) in temporary branches off of `dev`.**  All PRs from forked repos must also be submitted against `dev`; the `release` branch is **only** updated from `dev` via PRs created by the core development team.  All other changes submitted to `release` will be rejected.
